Just my personal dotfiles and some scripts.

Please note these are very specifically tailored to me, so if you happen to come across this, I don't take any responsibility for potential system breakage or whatever.
Use it as a reference if you'd like, though! Maybe at some point when I consider it done "enough" I'll add some actual information and maybe even some screenshots to this.
